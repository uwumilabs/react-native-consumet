## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-consumet
# or yarn add react-native-consumet
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This library has been primarily tested on Android devices. iOS testing is currently limited due to lack of MacBook access. Some providers (like Zoro, FlixHQ) may not work correctly on iOS. Contributions from developers with iOS testing capabilities are greatly appreciated!

> [!NOTE]
> This library is actively maintained but may occasionally lag behind the latest Consumet API changes. The project is in early development and some features may be incomplete or require refinement. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Quick Start

```js
import { ANIME } from 'react-native-consumet';

// Initialize the provider (e.g., Zoro)
const zoro = new ANIME.Zoro();

// Example usage in a component
const MyAnimeComponent = () => {
  const [animeList, setAnimeList] = useState([]);

  const fetchAnime = async () => {
    try {
      const results = await zoro.search('one piece');
      setAnimeList(results.results);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching anime:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    // Your component JSX
  );
};
```

## ✨ Features

- **🎬 Multi-Provider Support**: Anime, Movies, Manga, Light Novels, and more
- **🔧 Extension System**: Dynamic provider loading with unified API
- **📱 React Native Optimized**: Built specifically for mobile applications
- **🔍 Cross-Provider Search**: Search across multiple providers simultaneously
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for every use case
- **🤝 Active Community**: Open source with regular updates

## 🔒 Security

Provider and extractor code is fetched at runtime and executed via `new Function()`. The library protects against CDN compromise and MITM attacks using **SHA-256 subresource integrity** — every entry in `extension-registry.json` carries a hash of its compiled JS file, verified before execution. `factoryName` values are also validated as bare identifiers before being interpolated into the function template.

See [docs/security.md](./docs/security.md) for the full threat model and guidance for custom registry consumers.
